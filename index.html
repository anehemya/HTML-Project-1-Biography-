        Isadore Twersky (also known as Yitzhak Asher Twersky, October 9, 1930 â€“ October 12, 1997)
         was an Orthodox rabbi and Hasidic Rebbe, and university professor who held the position
          as Nathan Littauer Professor of Hebrew Literature and Philosophy at Harvard University,
           a chair previously held by Harry Austryn Wolfson. Twersky was an internationally recognized
            authority on Rabbinic literature and Jewish philosophy. He was especially known as an 
            international expert in the writings and influence of the 12th-century Jewish legalist 
            and philosopher Maimonides, and Abraham ben David, the Rabad of Posquieres.

        His best-known works are, An Introduction to the Code of Maimonides (Mishneh Torah), 
        and the more popular anthology, A Maimonides Reader, as well as Rabad of Posquieres: 
        A Twelfth-Century Talmudist, which was based on his doctorate work. He was the editor 
        of the Harvard Studies in Medieval Jewish History and Literature (in three volumes), 
        won a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1989, and was a fellow of both the American Academy for
         Jewish Research and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. According to Hacker 
         (2005), Twersky can best be characterized as a "historian of ideas and a researcher of 
         the intellectual history of the Jews," and would presumably have considered himself as such.
